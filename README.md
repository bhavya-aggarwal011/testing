Smart Curriculum & Attendance App
This project is a conceptual front-end application for a "Smart Curriculum & Attendance App." It is built using React and TypeScript, focusing on demonstrating a user interface for a school management system.

Disclaimer: This is a simplified, front-end-only example and does not include a functioning backend, database, or API integration. The data is hard-coded for demonstration purposes.

Key Features
Student Dashboard: Displays a list of students with their attendance status.

Attendance Tracking: Visually represents attendance status (Present, Absent, Late) using color-coded cards.

Upcoming Activities: Lists important academic activities with their due dates.

Responsive UI: The layout is designed to be clean and easy to read.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors early.

CSS: For styling the components.

Project Structure
src/App.tsx: The main application component that orchestrates the dashboard and activities list.

src/StudentCard.tsx: A reusable component for displaying a single student's information.

src/types.ts: TypeScript interfaces for defining the data structures used in the application.

src/App.css: Global styles for the main app layout.

src/StudentCard.css: Specific styles for the StudentCard component.

How to Run (Conceptual)
Since this is a front-end only example, you would typically run it in a React development environment.

Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

Create a React App: You would start by creating a new React app with TypeScript.

Replace Files: Copy the code from the provided App.tsx, StudentCard.tsx, types.ts, App.css, and StudentCard.css into their respective files in your src/ directory.

Install Dependencies: Run npm install to install necessary packages.

Run the Application: Use npm start to run the app in your browser.

Future Enhancements
Backend Integration: Connect the front-end to a database (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB) and a RESTful API.

Real-time Updates: Implement real-time features using WebSockets or Firebase to show live attendance status.

User Authentication: Add login functionality for teachers, students, and parents with different roles and permissions.

Attendance Automation: Implement features like QR code scanning or facial recognition for marking attendance.

Curriculum Management: Create a full-featured section for teachers to manage lesson plans, upload materials, and assign homework.

Detailed Analytics: Add charts and graphs to visualize attendance trends, performance metrics, and student engagement.
